# 🔐 Securing Cisco Switch Management Access

## 🔧 Description
This project demonstrates key techniques for securing Cisco switch management, including:
- Enabling SSH and disabling Telnet
- Configuring port security
- Isolating switch management via VLAN 99


## 🖥️ Lab Topology
- 1 Cisco switch
- 4 PCs (Admin PC on VLAN 99, others on VLANs 10 & 20)
- Separate VLAN for management interface
- Port security configured on all access ports

## 🚀 Configuration Summary

### SSH Setup:
- Created RSA keys
- Enabled SSH version 2
- Used `login local` and strong credentials

### Port Security:
- One MAC per port
- Sticky MAC enabled
- Shutdown on violation

### VLAN Management:
- VLAN 99 for management
- Management interface IP: 192.168.99.10

## 📷 Screenshots
- CLI output of SSH login
- Port shutdown after violation
- VLAN assignment

## ✅ Verification Steps
- SSH into switch from PC-Admin
- Unplug and replug device to trigger port violation
- Ping between VLANs (should be blocked)

## 🗃️ Files Included
- `.gns3project` file
- Configuration `.cfg` files
- Topology image
- README.md

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- How to secure switch management planes
- VLAN isolation for admin access
- Using sticky MACs and violation actions
